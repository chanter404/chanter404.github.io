		<div class="text">
			<p>Our story begins with a group of adventurers living in the medieval kingdom of Larion. The kingdom is filled with small villages and thatched cottages and has been relatively peaceful until now. The adventurers are on a quest to find the magical staff of Zalos. They walk through the forest and notice a band of mountain dwarves. The dwarves are friendly and offer them food and drink. Then one of the dwarves turns to them and says, "Why are you looking for that thing anyway? You might want to pass on that quest. I wouldn't."			Then the adventurers are attacked by a pack of wolves.</p>
			<p>swaped watch around to find some weapon.</p>
			<p>The adventurers quickly decide to swap their normal watches around, so that the dwarves have the watches with their magic powers and the adventurers have the watches that allow them to time-travel.</p>
			<p>"OK," says the dwarf,</p>
			<p>Harry used magic watches to time-travel.</p>
			<p>The watch that usually tells you what time it is works now. The watch that allows you to move through space and time works now as well. then 2 adventures Swaped and Harry used the watches to time travel in time when larion kingdom wasn't built yet.</p>
			<p>"Look," says the dwarf, "We were here first."</p>
			<p>"We're from the future," says one adventurer.</p>
			<p>"Nope," says the dwarf,</p>
			<p>swaped look around to see differences from the future.</p>
			<p>The dwarf is right. There are differences. The kingdom of Larion is bigger, there are more people, and there are many more buildings.</p>
			<p>"Let's just go back to our time."</p>
			<p>swaped says "no! we are going to end this mission "</p>
			<p>"Fine!" says Harry.</p>
			<p>"Fine," says Swapped.</p>
			<p>The dwarf is shocked.</p>
			<p>swaped took their stuff and watches to go out of here.</p>
			<p>The adventurers leave the dwarfs</p>
			<p>"They are idiots" says Swapped.</p>
			<p>swaped says "Harry lets found this stupid magician "</p>
			<p>"Yes," says Harry.</p>
			<p>They walk for awhile and find a small house.</p>
			<p>"Let's rest for a bit," says Swapped.</p>
			<p>Harry says "Yep"</p>
			<p>"OK," says Harry.</p>
			<p>Harry walks to the house and goes inside. Swaped goes with him</p>
			<p>swaped view this watch.</p>
			<p>The watch tells Swapped that he is in the future.</p>
			<p>"This isn't possible," says Swapped.</p>
			<p>swaped show this to Harry.</p>
			<p>The watch shows Swapped is in the future.</p>
			<p>"Look," says Harry, "I'm from the future. I don't want to be here either."</p>
			<p>swaped says "look, Harry we can find this stupid magic stuff here easyer then in our time"</p>
			<p>"How?"</p>
			<p>"Look, you know how magic works. If we find some, then we can go back to our time. If we don't, we'll stay here"</p>
			<p>swaped says "but we have this watches"</p>
			<p>"I know, but we have to be careful. I don't want to get caught. Look we can go back to our time easyer if we go look for a place that we can do magic" Harry and Swaped used magic watches to time-travel in they time.</p>
			<p>After they left the future, they went through the forest to the place where magic can happen. They noticed a circle of standing stones. They approached the circle and the dwarf said dwarf said - dont mess around with time guys,</p>
			<p>"Look around the circle" he said.</p>
			<p>Harry and Swapped looked around the circle. They could see the grass around the circle was different. There were no trees, but there were bushes and flowers.</p>
			<p>Harry says "Wow"</p>
			<p>"This is the future, man," says Swapped, "we can change things here"</p>
			<p>"Let's go back to our time," says Harry, "If we don't, we'll be stuck here" Swaped and Harry in theirs time.</p>
			<p>swaped says "maybe watches are broken?"</p>
			<p>"Maybe," says Harry, "Maybe not."</p>
			<p>They went back to their time. They didn't find any differences between their time and their future, but they kept walking.</p>
			<p>Then they came to a small hut."I don't know," says Harry, "Let's go find out."</p>
			<p>They went back to the house. They had a talk with the dwarf. The dwarf gave them some advice</p>
			<p>Harry says "What if dwarfs make this watches?"</p>
			<p>"Then we will be stuck here," says the dwarf, "You guys have other watches? We can get more advice"</p>
			<p>"Maybe," says Harry, "But that's a big maybe."</p>
			<p>swaped break watches.</p>
			<p>"We have to try," says Harry.</p>
			<p>They returned to the standing stones. They found a large circle of standing stones. The dwarf was there with two other dwarves. They showed the adventurers how the magic watches worked.</p>
			<p>swaped back in their time with 50/50 percent.</p>
			<p>"How do we know if we did it right?" says Swapped, "It's 50/50% whether we did it right or not."</p>
			<p>"We can try again," says Harry. Watches broke and return time in normal state.</p>
			<p>They went to the house. They had a talk with the dwarf.</p>
			<p>The dwarf gave them some advice</p>
			<p>"Don't mess around with time," he said,</p>
